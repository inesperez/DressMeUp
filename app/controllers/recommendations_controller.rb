          Match my clothes together based on their descriptions to create potential outfits that combine 2 garments,
          a top and a bottom. Rank them from the best-looking to the worst-looking outfits. Consider the following preferences:
          Occasion: #{@occasion} and #{@custom_occasion} and , Feeling: #{@feeling}. Output the ranked outfits
          **only** as a combination of garment IDs in **JSON format** called 'matches' which contains **only**
          the matched IDs in an array #{@garments}

          The output **must** follow this exact format:
            { \"matches\": [ [top1, bottom1], [top2, bottom2], [top3, bottom3], ... ] }

          Replace 'top1', 'bottom1', etc., with the actual garment IDs in integer format. Do not include any other text, explanations,
